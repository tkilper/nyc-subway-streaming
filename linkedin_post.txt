I built a prototype streaming data pipeline for NYMTA trip analytics:



https://github.com/tkilper/nyc-subway-streaming



The data is ingested from MTA's free API into Kafka, transformed in real-time using PyFlink, and loaded into a Postgres database from which I'm running calculations for real-time trip schedule visualization and anomaly detection.



It was tough, but a lot of fun, figuring out this project, and I learned so much.



Please feel free to take a look and provide any recommendations for improvements or new features if you have them. Thanks for reading!
