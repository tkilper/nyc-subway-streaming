Overview
========

Hi! This project is my homemade, locally deployed streaming ETL pipeline. It ingests real-time NYC subway data from the free online API (https://api-endpoint.mta.info/Dataservice/mtagtfsfeeds/nyct%2Fgtfs-ace) using Apache Kafka and processes it in real-time with Apache Flink to deliver real-time analytics such as average trip times and delays

Programming Languages: Python, SQL

Technologies: VS Code, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Metabase (Data Visualization), Postgres (Data Warehouse)
